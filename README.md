🚀 AI‑Powered Personalized Learning Mentor with Adaptive Assessments

      TEAM‑133 — DATA DETECTIVES | GenAI Hackathon Project

📘 Project Overview
  Traditional education often follows a one‑size‑fits‑all model. Students learn at different speeds and face unique challenges, while teachers cannot personalize learning for every individual.
This project introduces an AI‑Powered Personalized Learning Mentor that acts as a 24×7 intelligent personal tutor, capable of:
✅ Understanding student learning behavior
✅ Generating simplified concept explanations
✅ Building adaptive assessments
✅ Tracking progress and mastery
✅ Recommending next topics based on performance
✅ Providing a chatbot‑style mentor for doubts

🎯 Problem Statement
Students often struggle with:
- Complex concepts
- Lack of personalized guidance
- No adaptive assessments
- Difficulty identifying weak areas
- Limited teacher bandwidth for personalized support
📌 Our AI mentor adapts to each student's needs and fills this gap.

💡 Proposed Solution
We built a personalized learning system powered by HuggingFace LLMs and Gradio UI.
The system dynamically adjusts to each student’s performance and provides:
🔹 1. Intelligent Concept Explanations
- Explains topics in simple language
- Adjusts explanation depth based on student level
- Provides real‑world examples
🔹 2. Adaptive Assessment Engine
- Generates MCQs using FLAN‑T5
- Automatically adjusts difficulty (easy → medium → hard)
- Gives detailed explanations for each answer
🔹 3. Student Progress Insights
- Tracks accuracy per topic
- Identifies weak areas
- Recommends next topics to study
🔹 4. Chatbot Mentor
A conversational AI that answers doubts and guides the student.

Your README is already strong, clean, and hackathon‑ready. The structure is solid, the flow is logical, and the content clearly explains your system.
But if you want to make it perfect for judges, here are 3 small improvements you can add:

✅ 1. Add a “Features Summary Table” (Judges love quick scanning)
This helps them understand your system in seconds.
## ✅ Key Features Summary

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Personalized Learning Path | Recommends topics based on mastery |
| Adaptive MCQs | Difficulty adjusts automatically |
| Topic Explanations | Beginner‑friendly explanations |
| Progress Dashboard | Tracks performance & mastery |
| Chatbot Mentor | Answers doubts conversationally |
| Gradio UI | Clean, interactive interface |



✅ 2. Add “How to Run” Instructions
Judges often check if your project is reproducible.
## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab  
2. Run all cells (Runtime → Run all)  
3. The Gradio interface will launch automatically  
4. Use the public link to interact with the app  



✅ 3. Add a Short Conclusion
This gives your README a professional finish.
## 🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how GenAI can transform education by offering personalized, adaptive, and interactive learning experiences.  
It empowers students to learn at their own pace and helps teachers scale personalized support.
