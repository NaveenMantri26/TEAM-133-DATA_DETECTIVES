# 🎓 AI‑Powered Personalized Learning Mentor with Adaptive Assessments  
### TEAM‑133 — DATA DETECTIVES  
GenAI Hackathon Project

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Traditional education systems often follow a **one‑size‑fits‑all** approach where every student learns at the same pace.  
This leads to:

- Students struggling with difficult concepts  
- No personalized learning assistance  
- Lack of adaptive assessments  
- Limited teacher time for individualized feedback  

Our project solves this by building an **AI‑Powered Personalized Learning Mentor** that dynamically:

✔ Assesses student understanding  
✔ Provides tailored learning content  
✔ Generates adaptive quizzes and explanations  
✔ Helps learners progress at their own pace

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Students in traditional education systems:

- Learn at varying speeds  
- Have different strengths and weaknesses  
- Lack personalized feedback  
- Lose motivation when concepts aren’t understood  

Teachers cannot provide individual attention due to time and scale constraints.

There is a need for an **intelligent system** that:

- Understands student performance  
- Personalizes learning materials  
- Generates adaptive assessments  
- Improves retention and learning efficiency

## 💡 Proposed Solution

We propose a **GenAI‑powered mentor system** that:

### 🔹 Understands learning material using RAG  
- Extracts concepts  
- Retrieves relevant information  
- Gives contextual explanations  

### 🔹 Analyzes student performance  
- Tracks learning progress  
- Identifies weak areas  
- Adjusts difficulty level dynamically  

### 🔹 Generates adaptive assessments  
- Personalized quizzes  
- Concept‑level explanations  
- Instant feedback  

### 🔹 Provides mentor‑like guidance  
- Motivational support  
- Suggests next learning topics  
- Helps students revise effectively
