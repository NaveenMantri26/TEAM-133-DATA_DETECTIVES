# 📘 Adaptive Learning RAG System  
### TEAM‑133 — DATA DETECTIVES  
GenAI Hackathon Project

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is an **Adaptive Learning RAG (Retrieval‑Augmented Generation) System** that helps learners understand educational content more effectively by:

- Retrieving the most relevant information from learning materials  
- Generating clear, contextual explanations using an LLM  
- Providing an interactive Q&A environment  
- Supporting personalized learning for every student  

The system is ideal for **education**, **self‑learning**, **revision tools**, and AI‑powered tutoring.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Learners often struggle with:

- Understanding complex concepts  
- Locating relevant information quickly  
- Getting personalized explanations from their own notes  

Traditional learning tools do not adapt to each learner’s pace or content.

## 💡 Our Solution

We built a **Retrieval‑Augmented Learning System** that:

### ✔ Accepts and processes custom learning material  
### ✔ Splits content into semantic chunks  
### ✔ Generates vector embeddings  
### ✔ Stores them in ChromaDB for fast retrieval  
### ✔ Uses a HuggingFace LLM (FLAN‑T5) for accurate, easy‑to‑understand answers  

This makes the system **adaptive, intelligent, and fully explainable**.
