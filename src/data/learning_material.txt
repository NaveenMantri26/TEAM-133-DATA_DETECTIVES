Photosynthesis:
Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants use sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to produce glucose and oxygen. 
Chlorophyll absorbs light energy, which is then converted into chemical energy.

Newton’s Laws of Motion:
1. First Law: An object will remain at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force.
2. Second Law: Force = mass × acceleration (F = ma).
3. Third Law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

Pythagorean Theorem:
In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a and b). 
Formula: a^2 + b^2 = c^2

Cells are the basic structural and functional units of life. 
Major organelles include nucleus, mitochondria, cytoplasm, and cell membrane.

Basic Algebra:
An algebraic expression contains variables, coefficients, and constants.
Example: 3x + 5 = 14

Computer Science Basics:
A computer program is a set of instructions that tells a computer how to perform a task.
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem.
Machine Learning allows computers to learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed.

English Grammar:
